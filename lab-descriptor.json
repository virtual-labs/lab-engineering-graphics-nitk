  "introduction": "Engineering Graphics, also known as technical drawing, is a scientific method of communication between designers and manufacturing engineers. It is a precise and standardized way to visually represent technical ideas and designs. Established rules and standards emphasize accuracy and clarity, utilizing specific conventions, symbols, and projections to convey detailed information about objects and structures. This information includes dimensions, shapes, materials, and manufacturing processes. It is fundamental to various engineering disciplines, facilitating the creation and realization of everything from small components to complex systems.",

  "objective": "The intention of developing an Engineering graphics virtual lab is to provide a quick, easy and visual process for students to start experimenting with Engineering graphics concepts. Students can understand the basic principles of engineering drawing and construction of curves used in the engineering field. This virtual lab would help students to apply the knowledge of interpretation of projection in a different quadrant. Understand the projections of solids when it is inclined to both planes simultaneously. To sketch the 3D objects into different 2D views and understand the application of company standards and techniques applied in engineering graphics.",
